### Using the .jar files provided

The project has been compiled into several ```.jar``` files to facilitate execution on DCC Lab computers.


#### Launch the peers

Simply execute:

```
java -jar tom.jar {port} {network}
```

This will launch a peer on ```localhost``` at the designated ```port```.

The ```network``` parameter represents a list of hosts within the network (forming a complete graph of the peers).


#### Inject Start Token

Simply execute:

```
java -jar injectStart.jar {port} {network}
```

This will send the starting token to each host listed in ```network``` on the specified ```port```.

In this case, ```network``` should contain **all** the hostnames of the computers involved in the process.


#### Inject End Token

Simply execute:

```
java -jar injectEnd.jar {port} {network}
```

This will send a kill signal to each host listed in ```network``` on the specified ```port```.

In this case, it should be used to terminate the whole process, hence ```network``` should contain all the hosts in the network.

#### Example

```
@ L802
java -jar tom.jar 12345 L802 L803 L804
@ L803
java -jar tom.jar 12345 L802 L803 L804
@ L804
java -jar tom.jar 12345 L802 L803 L804
@ any DCC computer with access to L802, L803 and L804 (to start the process)
java -jar injectStart.jar 12345 L802 L803 L804
@ any DCC computer with access to L802, L803 and L804 (to stop the process)
java -jar injectEnd.jar 12345 L802 L803 L804
```

#### Compiling and running with ```gradle``` 

The ```.jar``` file can be generated by running the command:

```
gradle fatJar
```

This command creates a ```.jar``` file in the ```build/libs/``` folder with all dependencies included.
